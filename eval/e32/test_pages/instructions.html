                The purpose of this study is to see how you modify existing code
                to perform new tasks.
                In the following examples, I will ask you to <i>locate relevant fragments</i>
                of code in snippets I provide, and use them to perform a
                goal that I specify.
            </p>
            <p class='desc'>
                More concretely, for each task you will:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Read and understand a programming goal.</li>
                <li>View a code snippet and, sometimes, an accelerator.</li>
                <li>Write a short piece of code that completes the goal using 
                    what you found in the code snippet.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class='desc'>
            After viewing the snippet and accelerator, please use whatever tools
            that will most productively help you understand and solve the problem,
            including the Internet.
