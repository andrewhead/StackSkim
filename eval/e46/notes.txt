We found that a number of the regular expressions found were duplicated.
3 pairs of the 29 that were not matched were duplicates
38 of the 100 that were matched were duplicates

We therefore find that the total number of true detections is:
100 - 38
and the total number of detections is:
(100 - 38) + (29 - 3) = 62 + 26 = 88

We had a success rate, therefore, of
62 / 88
