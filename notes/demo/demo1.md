# Demo 1: BiD Reunion Demo

## The plan

Work with the three pages I already use as examples.
We'll start by improving the explanations that our Tutorons build:
* for wget, decrease the length of the value
* for CSS, generate more meaningful element names
* format the tooltip for the wget page
* make sure all the right examples are generated for regex

## Tasks

1. Go to web page with unexplained code
2. Locate explainable code that was detected by Tutorons
3. Show explanation
4. Illuminate the important parts of the explanation

## Brainstorming

### An interactive tutorial on Tutorons

1. This is a code example
2. It is not obvious what all the symbols do.  Tutorons will make this information available
3. They highlight code they detect
4. When you click on these highlighted regions, you see explanations
5. Explanations have two parts
6. They also explain CSS selectors
7. They also explain regular expressions
8. Try them out in the wild!

## Per-task options
