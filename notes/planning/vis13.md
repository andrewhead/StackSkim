# Vision 13: Costs and Benefits of Project Proposals

## Question

What projects should be my focus for the next year of work?

## Method

I focus on overarching questions, instead of precise technical solutions to problems.
I evaluate the value of a project based on these criteria:

1. Ability to pick up new skills
2. My current knowledge of the set of related work
3. My current knowledge of the relevant methods
4. Likelihood of leading into new research projects
5. Impact on the scholarly body of work
6. Impact on practice
7. Distinctness in relation to my community
8. Adherence to community's goals
9. Distinctness in relation to my peers

For each category I include notes.
To make the idea concrete, I also include clear first-steps to solving the problem.

I rank each of the criteria according to linearly-decreasing returns.
I add up each project for a score.
Then I write up about the two top projects that were scored, whether I think the rating is fair.
I pick which projects to do going forward.

The results are in the file `vis/13/decision_matrix.numbers`.

## Notes on Thoughts

One thing that's apparent about Tutorons is that there's a break between the community it helps and the community whose provides the technology.
The community that would be most excited about the technology is CSE.
But the community providing the technology is programming languages and software engineering.

The results of this experiment seem to be that I should focus on the following projects:
* Programmers' External Memory and Its Costs
* Rapid-fire development of Programming Getting-Started Docs
One of these has high scholarly impact and the other has high practical impact.
Both seem to be pretty quick projects altogether, and draw upon a body of literature I already know about and am passionate about.

With the close-by runner up of:
* Patterns for Useful Micro-Explanations in the Wild

Likely, the benefits of familiarity and knowing that I have a valuable contribution on these projects outweighs other elements.

The first paper on Programmers' External Memory could be a CHI paper, or at the Doctoral Symposium for VL/HCC.
The first paper on rapid-fire development could be submitted to ICSE.

## Some other notes from whiteboard sketches

### Questions

1. How do developers use external memory today, and what are its costs?   Should they use external memory?
2. What are the challenges to writing exceptional documentation, and how can technology come to the rescue?
3. What forms of information organization will most help workers in the upcoming wave of technology?
4. What trouble to people encounter with high-latency machines, and how can they avoid it?

### Players and Capabilities

Andrew: write papers
Matthew: develop
Austin: develop with gusto
Bjoern: Advise on literature.  Provide a connection to software engineering experts.
Marti: Advise on information retrieval, interviews, and natural language processing
Anca: provide motivation
