# Vision 8: HCI-related contributions of the Tutorons project

## Purpose

To begin integrating the work of Tutorons into a larger body of HCI work, I consider how its contributions augment the focus of major HCI questions.
The intent is to match Tutorons to a large community of scholars and academic questions.
Each category starts with a set of questions.
I embolden the questions that Tutorons could potentially help to answer.

## Observations

### About the Questions

Many of these questions revolve around effectiveness.
We have a certain problem in a certain environment, and want to know how to solve it effectively, with a general set of guidelines.

### Next Directions

It's likely more fruitful to review theory than to have a system in mind.
In addition, it's probably helpful for my career to have a few of these questions at the center of my work, to understand the approaches of others who are approaching these same problems, and collaborate for promising projects that are likely to yield insights into these questions.

Questions I want to learn more about include:
* What modern tasks are well supported by user interfaces, and which ones do we need to improve our technology to address?
* What are the most likely errors or frustrations people encounter while performing a task?
* How can latent but important information better be represented to take advantage of our abilities to sense?
* How do we enable people to navigate and find valuable information in vast collections of stored knowledge?
* How can today's technology be leveraged to better support successful, effective, and efficient design [of useful things]?
* What can people do better together with technology connecting them than when they work separately?

## Potential research contributions of Tutorons

* Low-cost, high-fidelity, data-driven micro-document generation
* Adapting micro-documents adaptive to detected or pre-coded user information needs
* Profiles of what beginners' information needsâ€”what should be included in instructions and tutorials?

## Categories

### Input Devices

* How can we help people to enter commands more efficiently?
* **How can we help people figure out how to solve their own problems by using computer programs?**
* What input devices are appropriate for what tasks?
* How can we more cheaply build existing pervasive input devices?
* How can we more reliably detect novel forms of interaction?

### Models of human interface use

* What are the limits to how fast and comfortably people can perform certain tasks?
* **What are the most likely errors or frustrations people will encounter while performing a task?**
* **How do people solve new problems when working with technology?**
* **What known human capabilities should be leveraged to make faster and more pleasant task completion?**
* How can we detect when a person needs help, and what kind of help they need?

### Design research

* What design processes best encourage successful problem-solving?
* **How can today's technology be leveraged to better support successful, effective, and efficient design?**
* What are the goals of design?

### Designing and implementing user interfaces

* How can we evaluate the quality of and rapidly iterate on user interface design to aid successful overall design process?
* **What modern tasks are well supported by user interfaces, and which ones do we need to improve our technology to address?**
* **What UI paradigms are most likely to enable users to complete tasks quickly and pleasantly with little training?**
* **What are the heuristics for an effective interface for a set of tasks?**

### Affordances of "connected" interfaces

* **What can people do better together with technology than separate?**
* **How do we enable people to navigate and find valuable information in vast collections of stored knowledge?**
* **How can large groups of connected people be organized to produce high-quality work for others?**
* **How does one effectively test an online interface given huge audiences and large amounts of collected data?**

### Ubiquitous computing

* What are the challenges for users who have to interact with and depend on large collections of ubiquitous computers?
* **How can latent but significant information better be represented to take advantage of our abilities to sense?**

### Physical interfaces

* How do we express ourselves and interact with the world?
* What are the mappings from typical physical tasks we complete to tasks we want to perform with technology?

### Information interfaces

### The human as a developer

### Groupware and social systems
