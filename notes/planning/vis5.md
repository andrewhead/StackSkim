# Vision 5: Brainstorms for Growing Tutorons

<!--
A web filled with high-quality Tutorons could be one where people shared ownership of all documents on the web.
Any confusion about side-effects, purpose, or mental models of code could be clarified by taking an extra minute with a short paragraph of description about that piece of code.
You know whether code will run the second you find it.

# Problems that Tutorons Solve

There is a ton of knowledge in this world.
Most of this expertise is tacit and belongs to a particular person.
If it was shared and at the fingertips of each person, 

## Challenges for currently maintaining community knowledge

* The infinitely long thread (forums)
* Long conversations (Wikipedia)
* Community politics (Wikipedia)
* Inability to revise (forums)
* Inability to summarize (forums)
* Organization that doesn't match the user's mental model (Wikipedia)
* The need for practice (piano)
* Cost of updating (Invention Lab wiki, BiD wiki)
* Difficulty to author (End of summer at Intel Beijing)

## A tangent: a problem that Tutorons doesn't solve

However, I feel that the greatest causes of building suboptimal systems are:
* a failure to quickly explore a design and its implications in the early stages and incorporate recent knowledge of best practices
* a lack of requirements to make sustainable products
* a rhetorical failure in making sure that people purchase and use sustainable products in a sustainable way

# A Manifesto for Tutorons

The tenets of Tutorons are:
* Make mental models instantly understandable
* Bring first and second-round follow-up information directly to where questions are asked
* Provide lightning-fast "lite" alternatives for performing simple tasks
* Eliminate repeated mistakes with the same artifacts (for a single user, and between different users)
* Describe concepts and actions in a way that's relevant and readable to the reader
* Point out high-quality descriptions and resources for users
* Direct to "pro" methods for standardizing repeated tasks

The metrics we use as a baseline is:
* Novices with a library should know how to reuse and adapt code within 1 minute of opening the micro-explanation
* Viewers of micro-explanations should be able to summarize what they learned in 1 sentence
* Programmers should not have to execute a follow-up search to reuse or adapt the code

The data Tutorons rely on are:
* The user's browsing history
* The user's history interacting with Tutorons
* The user's history building related artifacts
* Notes made by the past users
* Structured artifacts shared on the web
* Text accompanying those artifacts

Tutorons can be considered the first one of a class of **artifact-anchored annotations**.
These are annotations that accompany a structured artifact, rather than unstructured text.
By focusing on structured artifacts, annotations can be generated, and comments can be applied to other resources on the Internet.

# Kingpin Markets for Tutorons

1. Understanding a peer's code during code review
2. Clarify symbols used in a math paper and explain equations
3. Find relevant co-occurring arguments for reusing code
4. Editing a method to configure an open source project
5. Look up a politician's history in a news article
6. College students looking for substitutes for ingredients they don't have

# Challenges in Growing Tutorons (Opportunities for study)

* Getting askers to open them
* Getting askers to engage with them to the extent where they can learn from them
* Getting answerers to contribute comments to help out others with only an emotional reward
* Ensuring high quality of the content that users generate
* Getting askers to contribute answers after they have found a solution
* Joining related content into a coherent summary
* Enabling interactions so that people find the right one of many different explanations / demonstrations for an artifact
* Generating useful comments for infrequently-visited pages (making sure that annotations from other pages apply to this one)
