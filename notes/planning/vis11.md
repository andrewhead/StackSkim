# Vision 11: Researching Improved Authoring of Getting Started Guides

According to Dagenais &amp; Robillard (2010), it is difficult to write good getting-started documentation.
It is implied in that work that getting-started documentation should include non-contrived, realistic examples.

This boils back to a question of:
How do we enable fast and effective communication in extremely distributed, primarily online communities of practice?
One of these forms is enabling them to write better documentation for each other.

A preliminary question to answer about this is *what does the process of writing a tutorial look like?*
Who is the tutorial writer, and what efforts do they go to to write the tutorial?
Who are the potential tutorial writers, and when do they choose to *not* write tutorials?
What is some of the best documentation out there, and what makes it the best?
How can we instantiate this practice of documentation into a sequence of tools that will help someone share their work?

The tools that will be needed to perform this work comprise:
* natural language processing techniques (probably classic techniques, motivated by recent work)
* a corpus of very, very modern online documentation for open source projects
* a group of new developers who build easily-shareable packages, many of which have rich tutorials and succinct APIs
* a growing population of scientific programmers increasingly encouraged to open source their work
* an increased understanding of the crowd and their ability to perform design and cleanup tasks
The artifacts on which this study is grounded, the population it satisfies, and several of the tools it uses are all new.
These tools allow us to reassess how knowledge and artifact sharing can be improved today.

One interesting question to ask is whether these new packages adhere to the vision of great APIs set by Jeff Stylos and others.

## Follow-Up Notes

Let's resume our focus: what are the great insights I want to produce?

How do we reduce work for people by helping them share information about their work?
Note that this is most relevant for a certain type of worker:
the worker that needs to find new or forgotten information.
This is relevant for students, programmers, and researchers.
It's also relevant to people who are looking for HOWTOs for home construction and making.
