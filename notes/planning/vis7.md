# Vision 7: UIST-related contributions of Tutorons

## Purpose

To determine how my work might be considered valuable to the user interfaces community, I ask:
What are the potential user interface contributions of Tutorons to the categories of interest at UIST 2014?
We recall that contributions are typically in the form of a novel design method, rather than the application of past methods.
For each category, I list what that category's major purpose is, before suggesting ways that Tutorons could contribute.

## What Tutorons currently is

### Things that the larger Tutorons could do as a user interface

* Provides information that adapts to the surrounding document
* Supports fuzzy matching of user selections
* Enable rapid testing of new content
* Enable selection of examples where hints or additional knowledge should be applied in other documents

## Larger potential contributions of Tutorons

* Data-driven micro-document generation
* Micro-documents adaptive to detected or pre-coded user information needs
* Profiles of what people need to know when beginning a craftâ€”what information should definitely be included in instructions and tutorials?

## What UIST is

From looking at these categories, it seems that UIST is increasingly a conference that studies new media for interaction.
Many of the projects today focus on the general rather than the specific.
If we wanted to improve the way that people interact with computers for a subset of tasks, what hardware and software interfaces should they work with?
A contribution to UIST defines new interaction primitives to change the effectiveness, efficiency, emotion, or creativity of our interactions.

## Categories

### Extreme Computational Imaging

* Iterative testing of potential image transformations when making new CGI images

### Tactile Feedback

The improvement of how well we can sense digital objects and execute actions when we can feel the model.

### Large Displays, Large Movements

### Augmentation

### 3D \amp; Augmented Reality

### Sensing Techniques

### Intelligent Information Interfaces

### Flexible and Printed Electronics

### Tools for Programmers

Programming is cognitively demanding and many tasks are near-impossible.
Tools for programmers demonstrate models and methods of manipulating code in a way that makes tasks feasible or reduces their effort to trivial.
By new ways of displaying models, and new authoring methods for inputting and revising code, effort is lessened.

### Touch Input

### Tangibles

### Gaze

### Pushing Virtual and Physical Envelopes

### Wearable and Mobile Interactions

### Neurons, Affect, Ambiguity

### Hands and Fingers

### Complex shapes and properties

### Online Education

### Pens, Mice, and Sensor Strips

### Machine Intelligence
