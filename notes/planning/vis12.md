# Vision 12: Problems, Contexts, Devices, and Theory

This series of brainstorming is founded on the idea that great work is aware of problems, modern context, and furthering the devices that can be used to solve that problem.
Any solution should draw upon related theory.
Therefore, this round of brainstorming focuses on combining problems, contexts, and devices to think of new, significant and visionary research.

Problems, contexts, devices and theories were written on index cards.
Each of the four categories had a different color index card.
Problems, contexts, and devices were combined into groups of three cards or more.
When an interesting combination was found, I thought of a specific chunk of a problem that could be solved as a first step.

The card values and combinations are stored in `vis/12/idea_combos.numbers`.
