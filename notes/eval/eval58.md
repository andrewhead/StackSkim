# Evaluation 58: Challenges for Writing Getting Started Documentation

## Procedure

### A Loose Grounded Theory Approach

I'm interested in following a loose "grounded theory" approach to this evaluation.
This will be based on the guidelines provided in the Wikipedia article on grounded theory.
In particular, I will follow these steps:

1. Picking a main question I want insight about
2. Taking keyword notes only (no transcripts) from interviews
3. Applying codes to the keywords afterwards
4. Join in concepts, and make memos.  Digitize memos and store them locally
5. Continually develop a theory to answer the question.  Try to elicit a "core variable"
6. When returning to #2, determine who to ask next to gain greatest clarification on the questions
7. Stop when the theory seems to no longer evolve

### Central Concern

What is difficult about writing good, usable getting started documentation?

### Interview Questions

These are motivated by the central concern
1. How does someone go about writing getting started documentation?
2. Do you ever hear from clients of your package about the docs?  Do they ever ask you to change anything?
3. How has your document changed over time?
4. What did your document look like at the time that you released the package?
5. How did you know what was helpful about your docs?

Interviews will be semi-structured:
I'll try to touch upon each of the topics, but questions do not need to be asked with rigorous order or wording.

I only conduct an interview if I have thirty minutes afterwards to formalize the notes.

### Note-taking

The purpose of taking notes is to capture "incidents" of ideas.
I want to paraphrase each occurrence of an incident or pattern in a user.
I'll include these in a list form, sequentially preserved from the interview if possible.

During the interview, I will take keyword notes (2-3 words for each).
For the sake of speed, ease of maintenance, and avoiding conflicts of confidentiality, I don't record audio or video.
After the interview, I will type them up.
Each of the pages of interview notes includes:

1. The name of the person I was speaking to
2. That author's affiliation
3. The date and time of the chat
4. A list of incidents

For each note, I mark whether it is verbatim, a paraphrase, an observation, an interpretation.
A list of reflections for use in later memos can be included at the bottom of each of the notes.
These methods for taking notes are based on the recommendations from Blomberg et al. (2003).

### Sample

My first group of interviewees will be tutorial authors working on a variety of projects and materials.
It will include authors for both smaller projects (e.g., peewee), and bigger, widely-popular ones (e.g., Django).
It will include both single authors (e.g., peewee), and multiple authors (e.g., Django).
It will focus on programming communities that involve a culture of reuse.
I know from my programming experience that this includes Python, JavaScript, Arduino.

### Expected Outcome

Nope.  Not going to do this.  This is, after all, a grounded theory approach.
