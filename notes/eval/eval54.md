# Evaluation 54: Why Makes Annotation Services Succeed and Fail?

## Overview

### Purpose

One of the upcoming projects I'm considering work on is collaborative annotation.
However, it's unclear what the current challenges are in making a successful, usable, useful, and widely used social annotation platform.
These factors can influence the products I build to aim in future products.

This evaluation seeks to clarify some of these factors and challenges related to building usable, useful, and widely used social annotation platforms.
For this case, I take a light ethnographic approach.
I ask past and present developers of social annotation platforms what works well and what doesn't.

### Summary


## Procedure

I consult developers from each of the following companies:
* [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/): a (rather successful) non-profit for annotation of web pages
* [Document Cloud](http://www.documentcloud.org/)
* [Mendeley](http://www.documentcloud.org/)
* HowTru
* SideWiki

For each company, I find a developer from the company (for instance, by consulting the Github profiles for the company).
I arrange for an interview with them over the phone.
When I call them, I ask the following questions:

1. Who do you think are the people that could most use annotations?
2. How much do you think people are using annotations?  What would be a good way to find this out?
3. There have been a lot of past companies that have tried to build large-scale shared annotation systems.  But most of them haven't succeeded.  What do you think went wrong?  Why do you think this space is so hard to succeed in?
4. To follow up on the last question, what do you think are the ingredients for success for building a successful, useful, widely used, and sustainable shared annotation system?
5. What do you think are some of the greatest challenges in growing your company?
6. What are some of the great open challenges in developing an extremely useful shared annotation system and user-facing interface?

### Preparation

For each of the above companies, I study:
1. What is the mission statement of this company?
2. How does this company distinguish itself from other companies?
3. How long has it been around?  What kind of user base and data does it have to support?
4. What is their target user group and their strategy for growth?

I do this by consulting the "About" pages for each of the services, read their blogs, and news releases about the company from the press.

### Expected Outcome

The deliverables from these interviews will be:
* An idea of the groups of user groups that can most benefit from annotations
* A set of unsolved interaction problems for better supporting the usability and usefulness of annotations
* A set of unsolved problems for technically building out and supporting annotation systems
